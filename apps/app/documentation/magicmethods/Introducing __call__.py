"""Implementing the __call__ magic method in a class causes its 
instances to become callables -- in other words, those instances 
now behave like functions. You can use the built-in function callable 
to test if a particular object is a callable (callable returns True for 
functions, methods, and objects that have __call__)."""


class Test(object):
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("\n args:")
        print(args)
        print("\n kwargs:")
        print(kwargs)
        print('-'*80)
